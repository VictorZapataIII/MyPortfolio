        <h1>Minecraft Map Projects</h1>
        <p>
          Before I knew anything about coding, I was very interested in making
          mini-game maps in Minecraft. At first I played on Xbox 360 Edition of
          Minecraft which was very limited and outdated compared to the PC
          verison (now called Java Edition). So in order to recreate what the PC
          was able to do using plugins, coding, and other resources, I had to
          work with what Xbox 360 Edition offered. Which was only a in-game
          system called redstone (basic wiring) to make my ideas possible. From
          this experience I was able to learn a lot of problem solving
          techniques and way of thinking that I later was able to used for map
          building in Java Edition of Minecraft and later in my coding classes.
          Two examples of my most recent projects is Castle Wars, and a
          Minecraft remake, of the popular indie game Five Nights at Freddy's
          made into Minecraft.

          class="center-image"

        <p>
          Castle Wars is a vanilla mini-game map I build in Minecraft. The idea
          originally came from a mini-game called Bed Wars which is on most
          popular Minecraft server one way or another. The concept is simple.
          There are two teams, the objective is to collect resources, trade them
          for materials and weapons, and cross the map to the other team castle
          and destroy their beacon. Players have infinite lives while the beacon
          isn't destroy, but if the team's beacon is destroy that team is on
          their last lives. Team left alive at the end wins.
        </p>

          alt="Generator Room"
          class="center-image"
        />
        <p>
          One of the difficulty of the map is making the generator room. In this
          room, player would be able to obtain ore gems from the blocks on the
          ground and they would be able to go to the trader room to use them for
          valuable items. These generators spawn in iron ingots, gold ingots, or
          diamonds at a specific rate, depended on the level of the generator.
          Each generator at the beginning of the game is set to level 1, or
          level 0 and it up to the player to upgrade them based on the
          requirement stated on the sign. They can be upgraded to the max level
          which is level 4.
        </p>
        <img

          alt="Emerald Island"
          class="center-image"
        />
        <p>
          In addition to the generators in each castle, their are 5 islands
          outside of both castles with diamond and emerald generators, each ores
          are offered to trade stronger gear back in the trade room so for
          players to be better equiped. They must build out to these islands. In
          fact, in order for diamonds to spawn in the castle, you need diamonds
          to get the generator to level 1, so it required for players to build
          out in order to gain these ores. These generators upgrade depended on
          time, every 5 minutes the diamond or emerald generators upgrade to the
          next level, to a max of 4 levels.
        </p>

          alt="Trader Room"
          class="center-image"
        />
        <p>
          The trader room is filled with the villager mob from vanilla
          Minecraft, but what makes them different is the custom trades they
          offer. Each villager theme is based on the items they give, and when
          you hover over the villager with your crossheir they are named for the
          items they are trading for. The different villager offer blocks,
          weapons, tools, food, enchantments, and even potions. This was
          possible as Minecraft allow users to edit almost all aspect of a mob.
          With the villager since they are the only mob that can trade, we can
          edit that part using a specific command. Each mob have their own
          predicates and parameters. Villagers have trades, slimes have size,
          you can even apply armor to zombies and skeletons. You can even turn
          off the AI of any mob in the game. These are just a few examples how
          Minecraft allows users to custom their game experience and allows
          people to make maps like this.
        </p>

          alt="Mob Room"
          class="center-image"
        />
        <p>
          One of the unique aspects to my map, is a room where you can send over
          mobs to the other team side to fight the enemy team. This can help
          distract the team or even end up killing them, setting them back a few
          paces. In the trader room there a villager that sell certain items
          which can be used on these traders to get spawn eggs. These spawn eggs
          range in difficulty of mob and the cost is appropriate for the
          strength of the mob. Stronger mobs cost more. Once you buy your spawn
          eggs you can drop them into hoppers at the end of the room, and they
          will be send over to the other team side. Once they reach the other
          team they will attack the other team and it up to the other team to
          defeat their distraction.
        </p>

          alt="Beacon"
          class="center-image"
        />
        <p>
          This is what I called the Beacon of Life. This is sitting in the
          throne in the back of the castle. The team has to protect their beacon
          anyway possible, this includes, putting stronger blocks around the
          beacon to make it harder for the other team to break it. Teams have to
          find ways of breaking into the beacon throne and try to break before
          times is up. However if teams are too slow the beacon will break
          within time leaving all teams on their last life.

          alt="Data Pack"
          class="center-image"
        />
        <p>
          Everytime I build a map, I always try to use a new feature Minecraft
          adds to help map builder make complicated maps. This feature is called
          Data Packs. These Data Packs are able to let players run in-game
          commands as the world runs. This feature allows players to add in new
          advancements, dimensions, function, loop tables, predicates, crafting
          recipes, structures, tags, world generation modifications, and biomes,
          without any coding modifications. Minecraft commands are in a way a
          coding language with each commands acting as a normal code statement.
          I use the data pack to assist with the generators, all of them (You
          can see key words like IronGenerator etc.). The way the generator
          works is that if I spawn in a armor stand with a specific tag, the
          data pack will detect it and depended on the level the armor stand is
          set to, will spawn the ore at a rate using scoreboard commands as a
          timer. However I needed to use in-map command blocks to help with
          upgrading the generators. This honestly is a simple data pack, as it
          my first. I am currently working on upgrading the data pack so I can
          spawn it with a simple spawn egg and have the upgrade feature go a
          little more smoothy without in-map command blocks assisting the
          upgrading procress.

        <p>
          Five Nights at Freddy's Map Remake has been an ongoing project I been
          working on since the series had came out. This project has span from
          multiple tries of making the map, each time making the map I use
          better techniques to complete my goals. This map project uses many
          commands blocks and a resource pack that I made from stretch. The map
          was original started as a multiplayer remake map where players became
          the animatronics and attack the guard. Since then, I made a better
          resource pack, updated textures and adding sounds effects from the
          actually game. With this recent redo of the map I had added AI so that
          the animatronics can still remain active even if a player isn't in
          control, and this includes a hardcore mode, where the AI moves much
          faster and less unpredictable.
        </p>
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/83357138-8a96-4193-aaae-3c3f1ee07b6d%2FCharacter%20Select.png?v=1595992874823"
          alt="Character Select"
          class="center-image"
        />
        <p>
          Once you exit the main hub, you head into this room where you can
          customize the night, this specific side of the room includes the
          character select. The options being the Night Guard, Freddy, Bonnie,
          Chica, and Foxy. It important that their is always a Guard, as the
          Guard starts the night when players are ready. Other players can
          select one of the animatronics and they will get armor and be
          teleported into the map when the game starts. The objective of the
          guard is to survive until 6am (about 9 minutes in real life time, as
          long as the original game) and the objective of the animatronic is to
          end the night guard before 6am. If no one picks an animatronic it will
          be replace by an AI armor stand and move on it own throughout the
          night. If players don't pick an animatronic they will be put into
          spectator mode, where they can teleport freely and can't interact with
          the map. Just as a side note, in this room also includes the Phone
          Call, which I voice acted for, which acts like a tutorial.
        </p>
        <img

          alt="AI Area"
          class="center-image"
        />
        <p>
          On the other side of the character select is the AI side where players
          can customize the AI of the animatronics. On the right side, you have
          the option of turning off Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy, and a bonus
          character Golden Freddy AI. Turning off the AI won't effect anything
          if the players picks the character, as when a player chooses an
          animatronic the AI is automatically turned off. On the left side, is
          the button that activates hardcore mode, which makes the Freddy,
          Bonnie, and Chica more active and unpredictable than a standard night.
          As the creator of the map, it took me a good 8 attempts before beating
          it for the first time. It definitly gives the map a much needed
          difficulty boost. Hardcore mode can be activated while players are
          animatronic, however it will not effect any player timers and
          cooldowns as humans are already as unpredicable as it stands.
        </p>

          alt="Office"
          class="center-image"
        />
        <p>
          This is the office where the night guard is. Inside, like in the
          original game, includes a poster of the main animatronics, some
          children drawings and a course two blast doors and lights, with
          companying buttons. Let not forget the most dangerous object in the
          room, the fan. The guard also equiped with a camera, where they can
          use to see the different areas of the map and keep taps on the
          animatronics locations. Throughout the night every players knows the
          power left in the office, it determined by the guard usage of doors,
          lights, and the cameras, and what time it currently is, represented by
          the green number above the hub bar.
        </p>
        <img

          alt="Show Stage"
          class="center-image"
        />
        <p>
          When the night starts, the animatronics begin off at the Show Stage,
          the Guard can view the Show Stage using their camera. Also as a note
          when the night starts and every time an interval of time passes titles
          will appear announcing to all players that it the next hour. But as
          the animatronics you also get a camera which tell you where you can
          teleport next, moving you closer to the office. AI just run through
          the map normally, but players have the option of being decisive when
          they choose to move or attack.
        </p>

          alt="Bonnie Office"
          class="center-image"
        />
        <p>
          When the night goes on, animatronics will reach the office and it your
          job to keep them out, before they get into your office and end your
          night. Bonnie and Chica appear outside the office (like in the
          picture) before they attack the guard. One cool feature I added in
          this recent verison is that the animatronic will appear invisible when
          they get to the office door, unless you use the lights to view them,
          making it mandatory to use the lights to tell whether the animatronic
          is in front of the office. However, it is noted that Freddy, works
          different and doesn't appear in front of the door before he attacks
          (like he does in the original game) and instead attack straight from
          CAM 4B.
        </p>
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/83357138-8a96-4193-aaae-3c3f1ee07b6d%2FFoxy%20Running.png?v=1595992874750"
          alt="Foxy Running"
          class="center-image"
        />
        <p>
          The fourth animatronic, is Foxy and he works differently then the
          others. He starts off in Pirate's Cove (CAM 1C) and if you don't watch
          him on your camera, he will slowly leave the cove. If you neglect Foxy
          long enough he will begin to run down the hallway right into your
          office. New feature of the map, is that if Foxy's AI is on, an
          animation of him running down the hallway can be seen. If you react
          fast enough Foxy will bang on your door and steal a random amount of
          power, but if you are too slow you will be greeted with a jumpscare.
          This is why Foxy is incredible important to always keep watch of him,
          to prevent him from slipping away and possibly messing with your
          night. I'll also mention if you lose power in your office, you won't
          be able to use the doors, lights, nor your camera. A sequence will
          play where Freddy play a tune for you (like in the game), length of
          the tune is randomize, and if you make it to 6am you win, but if you
          don't Freddy will end your night.
        </p>
        <img

          alt="Door and Lights"
          class="center-image"
        />
        <p>
          When you press the red or white button you will turn on that sides
          respective door or light. Which each second you have your doors or
          lights on will drain your power more. So it recommended to only use
          them wisely, say an animatronic is outside your office. These are your
          only defense and messing up once will cost you your night, and you
          will be taken to the game over screen. But don't worry no animatronic
          can break down the door and they are 100% effective, that is unless
          you run out of power.

          In the original game, Golden Freddy is only an easter egg, however in
          my map he a new threat and can be very annoying if you see him at the
          wrong time. Only as an AI, Golden Freddy appears on CAM 2B, and can
          pull you from your camera into the office and if you don't use your
          camera again, he will end your night.

          This is the full map, showing all the command blocks. Command Blocks
          act as a single statement of code for the map. Each one help make this
          map possible, from the AI, starting the night, ending the night, and a
          course reseting the map. For the first game I'm surprised how few
          command blocks I used but compared to the previous FNAF maps I tried I
          definitly saw the procress I made with my spacing and usage of command
          blocks.

        <h1>Minecraft Modifications</h1>
        <p>
          Unlike building Minecraft Maps, Minecraft Modifications (Mods for
          short) involves coding and figuring out how java works. Lucky
          Minecraft is already a game coded in Java, so my issue was
          understanding how to actually code. So using tutorials on Youtube I
          began self teaching myself Java and building my first Minecraft Mod.
          From this exposure to Java I was able to understand and successed in
          my AP Computer Science course which I wouldn't take until my Junior
          year of High School. Since Minecraft is always updating I always try
          to keep my mod updated to the lastest verison, but as of right now,
          the lastest verison I have the mod is Minecraft Verison 1.14.4, which
          currently Minecraft is on 1.16.2. But here is my first mod I made, but
          the project is currently on hiatus.

          <h2>Custom Weapon Mod</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          In this mod I add in a lot of weapons, tool, and ores into Minecraft.
          This includes over 100 items and crafting recipes. About 5 new ores
          spawn in the world, including Ruby, Sapphire. I had fun making this
          mod and since this project started by me messing with a texture pack
          into becoming a mod. One of the builds of the mod includes a generated
          structure that could spawn the legendary sword Excalibur. However due
          to Minecraft constant updating that had to be remove temporary. Though
          this project is currently on a break, I am willing to go back into it
          and update it again hopefully adding more features. Like one of the
          items which I tried to implement was to obtain a sword once it breaks
          if you die with the sword the sword gets replace with a new sword.

        <h3>Fire Emblem: Valiant</h3>
        <p>
          For my AP Computer Science final project we were task to work in pairs
          to make a side scrolling game, however me and partner wanted to take
          our project in a different direction. The direction we took was make a
          2D plane, where we can move through the world and encounter enemies.
          We were only given 2 weeks to finish this, which means we weren't able
          to to implement all our ideas, but we did get 2D movement done, simple
          AI that allow the enemies to move closer to you when it was their
          time, a character select, and battle animations. My personal
          contribution was the battle animations, start and character select
          screens, and the enemy AI. Our project was one of the best of our
          class.
        </p>
        <h3>Unfinished Summer 2018 Project</h3>
        <p>
          After finishing the last project I wanted to use the starter code to
          make another game. This project I focus more on getting better at
          sprite animation making original sprites, and implementing a player
          control battle system. The options were to attack and or defend. The
          AI of the enemy was also made where they had a random chance to attack
          and or defend. I started work on making an overworld map, but stop the
          project their and haven't pick it up since.
