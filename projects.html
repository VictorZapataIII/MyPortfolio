      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <p>Here is a list of my projects that I have been working on and or completed in the last few years. 
      </p>
      <h2>Minecraft Map Projects</h2>
      <h3>Castle Wars</h3>
      <p>One of my recent Minecraft Mini-game maps I build. This map was a result of me experimenting with 
          Minecraft added feature of Data Pack, a way of running commands more naturally in a Minecraft world. 
          The data pack I added was a ore generator pack which allowed me to make ore, such as iron, gold and diamond, 
          spawn at a constant rate that can be upgraded to spawn at a faster rate. This idea came from a mod and a plugin, but with 
          Minecraft enabling users to being able to do stuff like this in the base game, I wanted to try if I could. Lucky it worked 
          and the map is currently finish. This map gave me an excuse to make villager with custom trades, which with the usage of commands 
          you can edit a mob to have these. 
      </p>
      <h3>Five Nights at Freddy Map Remake</h3>
      <p>Since the famous indie game series came out I been wanting to remake FNAF into Minecraft without any mods. This is my third attempt 
          making the map and probably the biggest changes I done. This map included textures pack, with sounds, basic AI, and allows multiplayer with players playing as the animatronic characters. 
          Originally the map was a multiplayer experience where players control animatronics and the guard, where the guard objective is to survive the night, while the animatronic goal is to 
          get into the office and jumpscare the guard. When I added AI now the things are harder for the Guard, now that the animatronics are always active, in some form. Even added a hardcore making 
          the AI harder to predict. This updated verison of the map I was able to utlize the scoreboard commands which allow timer and other facts easier to make, reducing the amount of Command Blocks the map 
          uses to work correctly.
    <h2>Minecraft Modifications</h2>
    <h3>Custom Weapons Mod</h3>
    <p>In this mod I add in a lot of weapons, tool, and ores into Minecraft. This includes over 100 items and crafting recipes. About 5 new ores spawn in the world, including Ruby, Sapphire. I had fun making this mod 
        and since this project started by me messing with a texture pack into becoming a mod. One of the builds of the mod includes a generated structure that could spawn the legendary sword Excalibur. However due to Minecraft constant updating that had to be remove temporary. 
        Though this project is currently on a break, I am willing to go back into it and update it again hopefully adding more features. Like one of the items which I tried to implement was to obtain a sword 
        once it breaks if you die with the sword the sword gets replace with a new sword. 
    </p>
    <h2>Java Projects</h2>
    <h3>Fire Emblem: Valiant</h3>
    <p>For my AP Computer Science final project we were task to work in pairs to make a side scrolling game, however me and partner wanted to take our project in a different direction. 
        The direction we took was make a 2D plane, where we can move through the world and encounter enemies. We were only given 2 weeks to finish this, which means we weren't able to 
        to implement all our ideas, but we did get 2D movement done, simple AI that allow the enemies to move closer to you when it was their time, a character select, and battle animations.
        My personal contribution was the battle animations, start and character select screens, and the enemy AI. Our project was one of the best of our class. 
    </p>
    <h3>Unfinished Summer 2018 Project</h3>
    <p>After finishing the last project I wanted to use the starter code to make another game. This project I focus more on getting better at sprite animation making original sprites, and implementing a player control battle system. 
        The options were to attack and or defend. The AI of the enemy was also made where they had a random chance to attack and or defend. I started work on making an overworld map, but stop the project their and haven't pick it up since.
