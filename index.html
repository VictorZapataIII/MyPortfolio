            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>  Hi my name is Victor Zapata III I am a college student attending Pace University. 
                I major in Computer Science and been working especially in the language of Java where I had made 
                multiple projects involve games modification, in game mechanics and using eclipse. Check projects
                 button to view some of the projects I had worked on. For the future I hope to be working at a 
                 large tech company where I can use my coding skills on projects that help people and or in game 
                 development. I also love giving back to community where I have return to High School to mentor for my Robotics team.</p>
            <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p>
                 I started my interest in Computer Science by making maps in Minecraft which involve using commands, an in-game 
                 mechanics which use simple java code statments in order to change thing in the game to make mini-games maps. In 
                 order for things to work in-game you need a complex understanding on what commands Minecraft offers and understanding what 
                 variables you are allow to edit. From my experience with messing with Minecraft, I took it a step up and begin to modify the game, by making 
                 a simple modifcations into the game using eclipse to write the code. It wasn't until my junior year in high school 
                 where I commited to an AP Computer Science class. Because of my prior experience with Minecraft and the face it was Java based, when I took 
                my AP class which was Java based I was able to understand the task that were being ask of me and successed with flying colors. Since that experience 
                I fell in love with coding and had a deep passion for it. It was then I decided Computer Science would be the major I would pursue in college 
                and now I heading down that path.
